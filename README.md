## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

This was a great refresher on layout fundamentals and clean, semantic HTML. I also practiced centering techniques using `display: grid` and `place-content: center`, and kept the design responsive with a mobile-first approach.

Hereâ€™s a snippet I'm proud of:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  background-color: var(--slate-300);
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
